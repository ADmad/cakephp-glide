# Cakephp Glide

CakePHP 3.x plugin to help using [Glide](http://glide.thephpleague.com/) image manipulation library.

The plugin consists of a CakePHP dispatch filter, view helper and a Glide response class.

## Installation

Install the plugin through composer

```
composer require admad/cakephp-glide
```

and from you app's root folder load using

```
./bin/cake plugin load -b
```

## Configuration

The plugin's bootstrap file writes few config values which you can override as
per your needs.

```php
Configure::write('Glide', [
    // Value of 'serverConfig' is passed as argument to Glide's ServerFactory::create() call.
    // http://glide.thephpleague.com/1.0/config/the-server/
    'serverConfig' => [
        // Path or League\Flysystem adapter instance to read images from.
        // http://glide.thephpleague.com/1.0/config/source-and-cache/
        'source' => WWW_ROOT,

        // Path or League\Flysystem adapter instance to write cached images to.
        'cache' => WWW_ROOT . 'cache',

        // Response class for serving images. You normally don't need to change this.
        // There's an official response class for CakePHP too but this one provides
        // more flexibility.
        // http://glide.thephpleague.com/1.0/config/responses/
        'response' => new ADmad\Glide\Responses\CakeResponseFactory(),
    ],

    // Use secure url to prevent URL parameter manipulation.
    // http://glide.thephpleague.com/1.0/config/secure-images/
    'secureUrls' => true,

    // Response headers to set.
    'headers' => [
        'Cache-Control' => 'max-age=31536000, public',
        'Expires' => true // Value `true` sets Expire to +1 year.
    ]
]);
```

## Usage

### Dispatcher

In your app's bootstrap setup the dispatch filter `GlideFilter` which intercepts
requests and serves images generated by Glide.

```php
DispatcherFactory::add('ADmad/Glide.Glide', ['for' => '/uploads']);
```

The above will make CakePHP run the dispatch filter for URLs staring with `/uploads`.
Change the value for `'for'` as per your needs.

While there does not need for a direct relation between image URL and path of
image under configured `source`, currently for simplicity direct mapping is
expected. So for URL like `domain.com/uploads/user/profile.jpg` for the default
config the source image should be under `webroot/uploads/user/profile.jpg`.

### Helper

The provided `GlideHelper` helps creating URLs and image tags for generating
images. In can load the helper using `$this->loadHelper('ADmad/Glide.Glider')`
in your `AppView::initialize()` method. Here are the available methods:

```php
    /**
     * Creates a formatted IMG element.
     *
     * @param string $path Image path.
     * @param array $params Image manipulation parameters.
     * @param array $options Array of HTML attributes and options.
     *   See `$options` argument of `Cake\View\HtmlHelper::image()`.
     * @return string Complete <img> tag.
     */
    GlideHelper::image($path, array $params = [], array $options = [])

    /**
     * URL with query string based on resizing params.
     *
     * @param string $path Image path.
     * @param array $params Image manipulation parameters.
     * @return string Image URL.
     */
    GlideHelper::url($path, array $params = [])
```

The main benefit of using this helper is depending on the value of `secureUrls`
config the generated URLs  contain a token which will be
verified by the dispatch filter.
